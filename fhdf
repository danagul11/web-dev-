    <h1>“The Road Not Taken”</h1>
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
And sorry I could not travel both <br>
And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
And looked down one as far as I could <br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth.</p>

        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <em>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger. </em><br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
       <em> Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe </em><br>
         <em> are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand. </em><br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
       <strong> You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
