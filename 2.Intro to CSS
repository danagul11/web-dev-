        <h1>Travel to Zakynthos island</h1>
        <p class="dana"> <strong>Zakynthos</strong> (also spelled Zakinthos; <em>Greek</em>: Ζάκυνθος, romanized: Zákynthos [ˈzacinθos] ; <em>Italian</em>: Zacinto [dzaˈtʃinto]) or Zante (/ˈzænti/, US also /ˈzɑːnteɪ/, Italian: [ˈdzante]; Greek: Τζάντε, romanized: Tzánte [ˈdza(n)de]; from the Venetian form) is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea. It is the third largest of the Ionian Islands. Zakynthos is a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region, and its only municipality. It covers an area of 405.55 km2 (156.6 sq mi)[3] and its coastline is roughly 123 km (76 mi) in length. The name, like all similar names ending in -nthos, is pre-Mycenaean or Pelasgian in origin. In Greek mythology the island was said to be named after Zakynthos, the son of the legendary Arcadian chief Dardanus.</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Nomos_Zakynthou.png/250px-Nomos_Zakynthou.png" alt="250px-Nomos_Zakynthou">
        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="dana">The ancient Greek poet Homer mentioned Zakynthos in the Iliad and the Odyssey, stating that its first inhabitants were the son of King Dardanos of Arcadia, called Zakynthos, and his men. Before being renamed Zakynthos, the island was said to have been called Hyrie. Zakynthos was then conquered by King Arkesios of Kefalonia, and then by Odysseus from Ithaca. Zakynthos participated in the Trojan War and is listed in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships which, if accurate, describes the geopolitical situation in early Greece at some time between the Late Bronze Age and the eighth century BCE. In the Odyssey, Homer mentions 20 nobles from Zakynthos among a total of 108 of Penelope's suitors.</p>
        <h1>Geography</h1>
        <p class="dana"> Zakynthos lies in the eastern part of the Ionian sea, around 20 kilometres (12 miles) west of the Greek (Peloponnese) mainland. The island of Kefalonia lies 15 kilometres (9 miles) to the north. It is the southernmost of the main group of the Ionian islands (not counting distant Kythira). Zakynthos is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long and 20 kilometres (12 miles) wide, and covers an area of 405.55 km2 (156.58 sq mi).Its coastline is approximately 123 km (76 mi) long. According to the 2011 census, the island has a population of 40,759. The highest point is Vrachionas, at 758 metres (2,487 feet).</p>
        <h2>Zakynthos was created out of the six former municipalities</h2>
